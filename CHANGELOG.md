# Changelog

## 0.8.4 — Stop phantom switch/alarm events on resubscribe and restart

- **Fixed** (#336): Universal Switch button presses (and motion / smoke-alarm
  events) could re-fire as **phantom events** when the SHC rotated its long-poll
  subscription (~every 24 h) and again on every Home Assistant **restart**. The
  controller re-delivers each service's current state on (re)subscribe; the
  device-trigger path (`bosch_shc.event`) for Universal Switches had **no replay
  guard**, so every switch's last keypress replayed at once — re-triggering
  device-trigger automations (e.g. "all lights turned on" with nobody home).
  The switch listener now tracks the last fired `eventTimestamp`, seeded from the
  device's current state at startup, and only fires when it advances. The motion
  and smoke / smoke-detection-system guards are now likewise **seeded at startup**
  so they no longer fire a stale snapshot once per restart. Genuine presses and
  real state changes still fire normally.

## 0.8.3 — Keep decimals for more Twinguard / thermostat readings

- **Fixed** (#352 follow-up): the same `int()` truncation behind the Twinguard
  temperature bug also coarsened three other readings the SHC sends as decimals
  — Twinguard **humidity** and **air purity**, and the Thermostat II **valve
  position**. These now keep full precision. The sensors display them rounded,
  so the visible value is unchanged; long-term statistics graphs are smoother.
  Requires **boschshcpy 0.4.2**.

## 0.8.2 — Fix Twinguard temperature reporting only whole degrees

- **Fixed** (#352): the Twinguard temperature sensor reported only integer
  values — stepwise 1 °C jumps and an apparent flat-line. The underlying lib
  (`boschshcpy`) truncated the reading with `int()`; it now keeps the decimal
  Bosch sends. Requires **boschshcpy 0.4.1**.

## 0.8.1 — Document Smoke Detector II intrusion-alarm scope

- **Docs:** clarified that the Smoke Detector II **intrusion alarm** switch (#174) sounds
  **only that one detector's** siren. Verified on real hardware (#322): it does **not**
  cascade to other smoke detectors / Twinguards and raises **no** Bosch app notification.
  There is no local-API path to force the whole intrusion-alarm system (`SurveillanceAlarm`
  is read-only; the IDS only supports arm / disarm / mute) — so a generic "trigger alarm"
  service is not feasible. README entity table now lists Smoke Detector II's `switch`
  separately with a footnote describing the single-device scope.
- No functional change — the 0.7.11 switch behaviour is correct as-is.

## 0.8.0 — Platinum quality scale + boschshcpy 0.4.0

### boschshcpy 0.4.0

- **`py.typed` marker** — full PEP 561 type annotations; mypy can now type-check against the library
- `SHCSessionAsync` — async-first session class (foundation for future async migration)
- All service + model classes exported from top-level `__init__`
- `certificate.py`: `not_valid_after_utc` (replaces deprecated `not_valid_after`)
- ruff + mypy CI gate in the library
- GitHub Release auto-creation after PyPI publish

### Platinum quality scale

All cumulative quality scale rules (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum) are **done** or **exempt**.

- Full mypy strict typing across the integration
- mypy gate now **enforced** in CI (was informational)
- 2915 tests passing, ≥95 % coverage gate

### Bug fixes (since 0.7.25)

**Stability / crash fixes**

- `UserDefinedState` crash on deleted states (#351) — Bosch API omits `'deleted'`/`'state'` keys when `False`; `.get()` fallback prevents `KeyError`
- `SwitchDeviceEventListener` duplicate `homeassistant_stop` listener — caused `"Unable to remove unknown job listener"` ValueError on every HA restart (4× per boot); removed since `async_unload_entry` already calls `shutdown()`
- `SmokeDetectorSensor.is_on`: `try/except (KeyError, ValueError)` guard on `alarmstate`
- `ClimateDevice` setup: `KeyError` guard on `session.room(room_id)`
- `config_flow`: `None` guard in `async_step_reconfigure` / `async_step_credentials` (prevented `AttributeError` on pairing failure)
- `rawscan` service: `return None` → raise `ServiceValidationError` (required for `SupportsResponse.ONLY`)
- 20 `services_impl` defensive guards for partial long-poll updates (`KeyError`/`ValueError`)

**Sensor correctness**

- Battery sensors: no longer show `unknown` / `low` erroneously — `BatteryLevelService.warningLevel` safe fallback → `NOT_AVAILABLE`
- `BatterySensor`: `self.name` → `self._device.name` in logger calls (was `None` during polling callbacks)
- `entity_id` deprecation fix (#296) — `trigger_id` now uses stable `unique_id`
- Climate `AUTO` mode guard — prevents jumping back to auto on `set_temperature`
- Number entity `None` guard
- Binary sensor unsubscribe + `ValueError` guard
- Event dedup + `ValueError` guard
- Switch `available` property fix

**Device compatibility**

- README: SHC I, SHC II, and SHC Classic all ✅ supported (corrected wrong claim)

### CI hardening

- `quality.yml`: pip install retry-with-backoff (self-heals when a just-released lib pin hasn't reached the CDN edge)
- `scripts/local-ci.sh` — mirrors Quality + Tests workflows locally for pre-push checks

---

## 0.7.25 — Gold quality scale

All 49 cumulative rules (Bronze + Silver + Gold) are **done** or **exempt**.

### Code

**`entity_registry_enabled_default = False`** on 5 sensors (disabled until user opts in):
- `CommunicationQualitySensor` — diagnostic ENUM, rarely useful day-to-day
- `ValveTappetSensor` — diagnostic %, changes frequently during heating season
- `WalkStateSensor` — MD2 walk-test state, only relevant during active tests
- `DetectionStateSensor` — MD2 detection-test state, only relevant during active tests
- `InstallationProfileSensor` — diagnostic, set once at device installation

`WalkStateSensor` and `DetectionStateSensor` also gain `EntityCategory.DIAGNOSTIC`.

### Documentation

New sections added to satisfy Gold docs rules:
- **Supported devices** — SHC controller compatibility table + full accessory table
- **Data updates** — long-poll push model, reconnect behaviour, timeout option
- **Use cases** — home security, presence-based comfort, energy monitoring
- **Automation examples** — 4 complete YAML examples
- **Troubleshooting** — common setup errors table
- **Known limitations** expanded from 4 to 8 items

### CI

- `scripts/check-quality-scale.py` — quality scale gate script (`--tier bronze|silver|gold|platinum`)
- `quality.yml`: Gold is now the hard gate (was Silver)
